# Introduction to probabilistic programming

Computations for the bayesian linear regression example are available in the 
[PyMC3 notebook](PyMC3 for boston dataset.ipynb), as well as additional links
for related subjects.

The second example is a slightly modified version of [this PyMC3 doc example by 
Thomas Wiecki](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/bayesian_neural_network_advi.html).
